|  What is this repo for?  |
+--------------------------+

I started this repo recently to put my PlantUML drawings for various modules in. The folder structure is as follows:
.
├── M<NR>
│   └── <TOPIC>
│       └── <DRAWING>
└─── M<NR>
    └── <TOPIC>
        └─── <DRAWING>
etc...

+----------------+
|  Placeholders  |
+----------------+

<NR>          ==> [DIRECTORY]  Number of the module, as described in the apprenticeship documentation for "Informatik Systemtechnik EFZ"
<TOPIC>       ==> [DIRECTORY]  The topic of the drawings in the directory
<DRAWING>     ==> [FILE]  The source files for the drawings. Only raw-text formats are supported (as of 2023-05-11, only PlantUML)

|  Final words for this README  |
+-------------------------------+

I do not care if anyone believes this document isn't written like a README should be. It is for me, not you, I just publish it on GHub for my own convenience
